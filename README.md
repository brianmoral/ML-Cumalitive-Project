# ML Cumalitive Project - Automated Feature Selection

We explore the 2012 CBECS to better understand what specific building features contribute the most to energy consumption. Our approach in achieving this objective includes the use of automated feature selection techniques from the wrapper and embedded method families, and the subsequent training of four different ensemble models which are individually evaluated with the SHAP method for greater insight into the effects of the selected features on each modelâ€™s power of prediction.

## DATASET

#### 2012 CBECS

The U.S. Energy Information Administration public data
set that contains untabulated records about energy consumption in individual
buildings across the U.S. The data set includes information about the square
footage of a building, electricity consumption, natural gas usage, if it is solar
powered, number of floors and many more attributes. The table holds over 1000
features which we will reduce to a much smaller more focussed set of variables.
